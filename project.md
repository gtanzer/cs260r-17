Project
=======

Your project is a verified system: a model of a complex system, or a complex
part of a system, accompanied by a correctness proof for some important system
property. Everyone is using Coq for their projects, but this is strictly
speaking not required.

The primary outcomes of your project will be a **project writeup**, of similar
length and density as the research papers we've read, and the **project
code**. Your writeups will be shared with the class.

> **DO NOT PUNT THE WRITEUP.** In previous years, I had one group turn in a
> writeup with _“lorem ipsum dolor” text in the abstract_. Another group’s
> writeup said “Our verification **VERIFIES SOMETHING HERE**”. This made me
> really angry and Bs were assigned.

Your project and writeup are due on **Monday morning, May 8th, at 10am.** This
is as late as I can make it.

We will have **project presentations** most likely during reading week.

Initial project writeup
-----------------------

Due **Monday 4/17 at 10am** is an initial project writeup. This should be no
more than 2 pages long (when formatted at 11pt, two-column, single-spaced).
One writeup needs to be submitted from each team. We will share the writeups
on class Monday and discuss them.

Discuss each of these major subjects. Every project will be stronger in some
areas and weaker in others; just be honest.

* What kind of system are you interested in?
* What property are you aiming to verify?
* Give a Coq statement of your capstone theorem. This theorem statement need
  not compile, it may rely on types you haven't defined yet, but it should
  correspond to the property you want to verify.
* What is your project schedule? What do you aim to have completed each week?
* What is your division of labor? Who’s doing what? How can you work in
  parallel?
* What are the risks? What are you most worried about in your development? If
  you cannot prove the capstone theorem, what simpler theorems are you more
  likely to be able to prove?
* What is your (hypothetical) future work? How could future generations build
  on your effort?

Final project writeup
---------------------

Due **Monday 5/8 at 10am** is the final project writeup and code. The final project
writeup should be no more than 14 pages long (when formatted at 11pt,
two-column, single-spaced). One writeup needs to be submitted from each team.
The model writeup is a publishable research paper.

I will share all project writeups with the whole class.

**In addition,** each **individual** must submit to me a contribution writeup.
This can be a short email. It should answer these questions:

1. What work did you do on the project?
2. What work did each other team member do on the project?
3. What grade do you think you should get for the class?

The contribution writeups will obviously not be shared.
